# GDD316

### Course Description

Modern games rely on a range of algorithms and mathematical techniques to generate compelling dynamic game mechanics. This course develops advanced topics through mediated examples, playtesting and collaborative projects. Students build working prototypes that leverage applied math to generate complex game mechanics. The course will review basic mathematical tools for game physics, transforms, trajectory and mesh generation. More complex behaviors and movements are addressed through algorithms for procedural generation, agents, artificial intelligence, swarms and dynamic surfaces.

### Tools and Languages Used

For this class, we primarily worked in Unity with C#.

### Portfolio Website

The only frontend for the work is on an individual [portfolio website](https://mywebspace.quinnipiac.edu/bajackson1/GDD_316/index.html) to publish our assignments. If you go to this link, you will be directed to the website where you can see the individual assignments and final project. I did this as well for another class, [GDD200](https://github.com/bjaxqq/GDD200). The backend for everything is here in the repository.
