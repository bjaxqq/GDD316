### Course Description

Modern games rely on a range of algorithms and mathematical techniques to generate compelling dynamic game mechanics. This course develops advanced topics through mediated examples, playtesting and collaborative projects. Students build working prototypes that leverage applied math to generate complex game mechanics. The course will review basic mathematical tools for game physics, transforms, trajectory and mesh generation. More complex behaviors and movements are addressed through algorithms for procedural generation, agents, artificial intelligence, swarms and dynamic surfaces.
